# IntelGram Update Log

## Current Update

- Base source: official AyuGram Desktop `v6.7.8` at `b25513a06ff88be0b3f4c928252b56c3da39cec7` with required submodules.
- Product identity: IntelGram on macOS, Windows, and Linux with separate application identifiers.
- Source delivery: one complete IntelGram patch plus deterministic branding and validation scripts.
- Build delivery: GitHub Actions packages macOS Apple Silicon, Windows x64, and Linux x64.
- Build reliability: macOS and Windows dependency preparation uses bounded cache stages, so a clean GitHub runner can finish without relying on an older warm cache.
- Universal vault: local FTS search covers received messages, media metadata, links, and filenames, with current-account, all-account, and unified-inbox views.
- Timeline tools: jump-to-date, conversation statistics, compact media history, saved moments, and locally observed edit/deletion history.
- Organization: smart folders, private contact notes and reminders, note history, opt-in public identity snapshots, and account-scoped local rules.
- Chat controls: local tags, priority, manual/Wi-Fi/always download behavior, read reminders, local-only draft preference, and local notification muting.
- Anti-spam: unknown-sender and suspicious-invite review tags plus keyword, link, photo, and file rules.
- Theme Studio: Windows 93, Terminal, Classic Telegram, AMOLED, custom theme import, and the existing IntelGram icon set.
- Export Center: selected-message, chat, and account HTML/PDF/Markdown/JSON/ZIP export.
- Frozen Account Backup: streamed AES-256-GCM `.intelvault` output with permitted cached media and no plaintext destination files.
- Existing feature scope remains: local profile fields, photo, high-fidelity profile clone, UID/visible-phone cached-peer search, native collection and item galleries, featured gift, pinned gifts, and fourteen app-icon choices.
- Collectible gallery: the collection screen uses native artwork tiles, each collection opens a scrollable exact-item grid, and clicking a collectible selects it without leaving IntelGram.
- Local gift recipient: featured, pinned, and cloned collectible details match local gift slugs immediately, use your active real or local display name for **Gifted to** and the **Telegram** profile chip, and open your own locally rendered profile without changing real ownership data.
- Compact profile consistency: the collectible's Telegram row now opens a card using your local display name, large profile photo, phone, usernames, bio, and personal channel instead of the collectible owner's server profile.
- Collectible owner consistency: collectible username and anonymous-number boxes now show your active local or cloned display name beside the locally rendered avatar instead of the underlying Telegram peer label.
- Clone fidelity: premium and verification badges, organization badge symbols, emoji status, and personal channel follow a read-only refresh of the already-known source profile; absent elements are cleared from the cloned local view.
- Username editor: the added original-username strip is gone and Telegram's familiar inline syntax/availability row is restored without a network availability request.
- Settings organization: local controls are grouped into identity, contact, photo, and collectible sections.
- Dynamic preview: the name-color sample follows the currently rendered local display name.
- Icon pack: pink primary and profile-art icons plus twelve color variants include native macOS, multi-resolution Windows, and Linux resources; macOS artwork is full-bleed and no longer receives a second white frame or inset.
- Settings cleanup: inherited Boosty and cryptocurrency donation rows were removed and replaced with IntelGram community, source, and changelog links.
- Community badge: joining `@intelgrams` through Telegram's normal channel page unlocks a local supporter badge; IntelGram performs no automatic join request.
- In-app update log: **IntelGram Settings -> IntelGram -> Update log** opens a bundled native summary without requiring GitHub.
- Current source patch SHA-256: `05fb4e01511ec67165e3428001bae0716f6cec3ef2de3538028bfe04ccd95ffb`.
- Privacy boundary: no Telegram profile mutation, contact import, automatic channel join, collectible transaction, or protected-content bypass.
- Protected content: Restrict Saving Content and self-destructing items remain metadata-only jump-back references; bodies, links, filenames, revisions, and media are excluded from rules, exports, and backups.
- Branding consistency: product-facing window, settings, version, and notification-preview titles use IntelGram while upstream attribution remains intact.
- Login and platform branding: the login footer, application menus, About and crash dialogs, tray labels, updater identity, and Windows shortcut metadata now consistently use IntelGram.
- Windows reliability: the final Qt dependency stage is serialized to prevent the `qtimageformats` generated-directory race seen in the previous run.
